                            A few blogs about programming & technology in general,
                            ranging from very practical, "here's what i did to solve
                            this problem" kinds of articles, to more philosophical or
                            soapbox-y blogs, talking about the impact of technology
                            on society and vice-versa.

                    <h2>What is this?</h2>
                    <p>
                        These are lists of cool blogs and podcasts I've collected
                        and want to share with others, distributed in the popular
                        <a href="https://opml.org">OPML</a> format. This allows
                        you to read them and keep up to date on the articles
                        published using an
                        <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise">RSS reader</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While OPML is generally used for backing up or
                        transferring static lists of blogs, a few readers (e.g.
                        <a href="https://freshrss.org/index.html">FreshRSS</a>)
                        support so-called "dynamic OPML," which is just a fancy
                        way of saying it will fetch a list of RSS feeds from a
                        (link to an) OPML file, and then check those feeds for
                        new articles.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Why do this?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Over the years, I've had a relatively big bookmark folder
                        filled with interesting blogs or articles, called "To Read".
                        For a long time, I just periodically visited the best ones
                        to see if they had any new articles to read, which was
                        somewhat of a chore and made me miss out on a bunch of
                        interesting stuff.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, last year I finally made the jump and started
                        collecting RSS/Atom feeds, which centralized everything
                        in a convenient RSS reader which would notify for new
                        articles. If you haven't tried that yet, I <em>really</em>
                        recommend it, it is supremely convenient and extremely
                        easy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But while I often read articles on my phone, I also stumble
                        on new blogs through <abbr title="StackOverflow">SO</abbr>
                        answers and github profiles all the time... on my laptop.
                        This meant I'd often have to get my phone and enter the
                        feed URL by hand. When I broke my phone, I started using
                        my laptop a lot more for entertainment, and having to keep
                        a synced list of the different blogs I read was kind of a
                        pain...
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After much beating around the bush, I've finally resolved
                        to just using a self-hosted RSS aggregator. However, I
                        also want as much portability as possible, so having my
                        list of feeds just be a text file I could edit whenever
                        I wanted to was my dream. In addition, it means it's
                        easier to share that list with others, and if I add
                        a new blog I don't have to update multiple apps or
                        places every time to keep in sync (like I have to for
                        <a href="/zsotd">zsotd</a>), since there's only
                        one source of truth: the OPML files.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        PS: When I've finally set up a static generator for this
                        site, I'd like to have an actual list of each blog in each
                        feed, so that they're easier to individually peruse (and
                        it increases their PageRank! let's go 90s!).
