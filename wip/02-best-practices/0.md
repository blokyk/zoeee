# "Best practices" are meant to be discovered, not followed

_Ever heard of the IKEA effect?_

I've been writing code for a little while now. Looking at my github profile, my first repo was uploaded in 2018. I was 15 at the time! All young and dumb, but I did know one thing: I didn't know anything. So, as the good soon-to-be-temporarily-embarrassed-professional programmer that I was, I understood that my only hope to improve and write to better code was, of course, to listen to people more experienced than me, to follow _best practices_, to use the _best tools_. After all, I was young and dumb, of course I wouldn't get anywhere by just writing code as I felt. Plus, I have a hard time doing things if I know they'll have to be changed a lot or thrown away. -snip-

For most of my time coding, I've been writing C# console apps or library, and while I mostly work in isolation, I'd like to think I'm mildly good at it now. But I recently had make a completely different kind of project (a mobile app, with Flutter), and this has radicalized me _against_ how we preach "best practices" to beginners.
